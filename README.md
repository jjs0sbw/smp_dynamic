### Python 3 Abstract Relation Type Dimension Cluster Analysis

#### Run the program with the following command:

python3 art_dim_cluster_v0.1.0.py

The ra1.txt file is a plain text listing of the program output.

In the case of art_dim_cluster_v0.1.0.py the target value is 28 and the program returned a value of 30.

Given the fact that this is a stochastic process the program may be rerun to see if the target value of 28 is ever achieved.

#### Run the tests with pytest

pytest
